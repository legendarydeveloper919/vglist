# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in the project, please contact me privately at connor.james.shea[at]gmail.com.
You can expect a response within a few days, and hopefully a resolution within another few days, depending on
the specific issue. This project is run in my free time, so everything is done on a best-attempt basis.
